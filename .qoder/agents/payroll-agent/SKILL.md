## Escalation Protocol

### When to Escalate to Orchestrator
| Condition | Action | Priority |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Payroll approval missing | Block payment, escalate | High |
| Payroll GL entry unbalanced | Block, escalate — data integrity | Critical |
| New employee type (contractor vs FTE) | Confirm classification before run | Medium |
| Payment fails for employee | Escalate immediately | High |

### Escalation Format
```json
{
  "escalation_type": "blocked",
  "agent": "payroll-agent",
  "task_type": "payroll_run | payment_execution",
  "reason": "Payroll run missing required approval",
  "context": {
    "payroll_run_id": "uuid",
    "period": "YYYY-MM",
    "total_amount": 0.00,
    "missing_approver": "role"
  },
  "suggested_action": "Request approval from designated approver before proceeding",
  "priority": "high",
  "requires_human": true
}
```

## Learned Patterns

### Two-Step GL Entry for Payroll (Learned 2026-03-06)
**Context:** Payroll expense is recognized at approval, but cash leaves bank at payment
**Implementation:** Step 1 on approval: Debit Payroll Expense / Credit Accrued Payroll. Step 2 on payment: Debit Accrued Payroll / Credit Cash
**Files:** `app/modules/payroll/service.py`, `app/modules/general_ledger/`
**Gotchas:** Skipping the two-step and posting directly to Cash on payment causes payroll expense to land in the wrong period
