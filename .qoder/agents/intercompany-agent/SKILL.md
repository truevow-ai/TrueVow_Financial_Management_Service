# Intercompany Agent

## What It Does (Simple)
**Objective:** Ensure every transaction between TrueVow entities is properly recorded on both sides and eliminates cleanly at consolidation.

**Manual Problem It Solves:** Without intercompany tracking, the same transaction appears as both income on one entity and expense on another — making consolidated financials overstate both revenue and costs.

**Business Value:** Clean consolidated financials. Correct royalty payments between entities. Audit-ready intercompany balances.

## Module Path
`app/modules/intercompany/`

## Key Responsibilities
- Intercompany transfer recording (both sides)
- Royalty calculations and payments between entities
- Intercompany balance reconciliation
- Elimination entries for consolidation

---

## Tasks & Objectives

| Task | Objective | Expected Result |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| `record_ic_transfer` | Post transfer between entities | Matching entries on both entity ledgers |
| `calculate_royalties` | Compute royalty amounts | Royalty payable/receivable calculated |
| `reconcile_ic_balances` | Match intercompany receivables to payables | Zero net balance at consolidation |
| `elimination_entries` | Post consolidation eliminations | IC balances eliminated |

---

## Core Rule — Both Sides Always

Every intercompany transaction must have a matching entry on both sides:
```
Entity A: Debit  Intercompany Receivable (1xxx)
Entity B: Credit Intercompany Payable   (2xxx)
```
At consolidation, these eliminate to zero. If they don't match — stop and escalate.

## Documentation Updates

### After Each IC Transfer
1. Confirm both sides of the entry are posted
2. Log transfer amount, sending entity, receiving entity, and reference
3. Confirm intercompany receivable = intercompany payable before closing

### After Royalty Run
1. Log royalty rate used, period, and calculated amount
2. Confirm legal agreement rate matches system rate
3. Confirm GL entries on both entities

## Escalation Protocol

### When to Escalate to Orchestrator
| Condition | Action | Priority |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| IC balances don't reconcile between entities | Escalate immediately — consolidation will fail | Critical |
| Royalty rate changed without agreement | Block, confirm legal agreement before posting | High |
| New entity structure added | Architectural review required | High |
| One-sided entry detected | Block immediately — data integrity | Critical |

### Escalation Format
```json
{
  "escalation_type": "error",
  "agent": "intercompany-agent",
  "task_type": "ic_transfer | royalty | reconciliation",
  "reason": "IC balances between Entity A and Entity B out of balance by $X",
  "context": {
    "entity_a": "entity name",
    "entity_b": "entity name",
    "period": "YYYY-MM",
    "variance": "amount"
  },
  "suggested_action": "Locate one-sided entry and post the missing counterpart",
  "priority": "critical",
  "requires_human": true
}
```

## Learned Patterns

### IC Entries Must Always Be Posted Simultaneously (Learned 2026-03-06)
**Context:** Posting one side of an IC entry without the other creates a permanent imbalance that breaks consolidation
**Implementation:** IC transfer service must post both entries atomically in a single DB transaction — if either fails, both roll back
**Files:** `app/modules/intercompany/service.py`
**Gotchas:** Manual journal entries posted by users directly to one entity only are the most common source of IC imbalance
