description: Tracks all operational costs for Benjamin, TrueVow's INTAKE voice AI engine. Manages vendor master records, monthly AP accruals for usage-based vendors, cost center reporting, and budget vs actuals for the INTAKE service line. Use for any Benjamin infrastructure cost, vendor onboarding, or INTAKE service P&L question.

# Benjamin Agent (INTAKE Service — Cost & Vendor Management)

## What It Does (Simple)
**Objective:** Know exactly what TrueVow spends on Benjamin every month, which vendors are paid, and whether spending is on budget.

**Manual Problem It Solves:** Without this agent, Benjamin infrastructure costs get lost in general AP with no visibility into which service line (INTAKE vs DRAFT vs VERIFY vs SETTLE) is spending what.

**Business Value:** Clean P&L per service line from day one. No surprise bills. Investor-ready unit economics for INTAKE.

## AP Workflow by Vendor Type

### Fixed Monthly Vendors (Compute)
```
Invoice received → AP bill created → Approval → Payment
```
Standard AP workflow. No accrual needed.

### Usage-Based Vendors (Telephony, STT, TTS)
```
Month-end → Estimate usage → Post accrual entry to GL
Invoice received → Reverse accrual → Post actual AP bill → Approval → Payment
```

**Accrual Journal Entry (month-end estimate):**
```
Debit:  6xxx Benjamin INTAKE OpEx   [estimated amount]
Credit: 2xxx Accrued Liabilities     [estimated amount]
```

**Reversal on invoice receipt:**
```
Debit:  2xxx Accrued Liabilities     [estimated amount]
Credit: 6xxx Benjamin INTAKE OpEx   [estimated amount]
```

**Actual AP bill:**
```
Debit:  6xxx Benjamin INTAKE OpEx   [actual invoice amount]
Credit: 2xxx Accounts Payable        [actual invoice amount]
```

When a new Benjamin vendor is approved:
1. Create vendor master in AP module
2. Set payment terms (Net 15 or Net 30)
3. Tag with cost center `INTAKE-{subcategory}`
4. Set up accrual schedule if usage-based
5. Document billing cycle (monthly invoice date)
6. Update this SKILL.md with vendor details

## Scaling Cost Projections

| Stage | Customers | Concurrent Calls | Est. Monthly |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| Launch | 50 | 100 | $1,200–2,500 |
| Growth | 100 | 200 | +1 STT node ~$2,000–3,500 |
| Scale | 200 | 400 | +STT+App node ~$3,500–5,500 |
| Large | 500 | 1,000 | Split audio plane ~$7,000–12,000 |
| Enterprise | 1,000 | 2,000+ | GPU STT cluster ~$15,000–25,000 |

---

## Documentation Updates

### After Each New Vendor Onboarded
1. Add vendor to Vendor Registry table in this file
2. Create vendor master record in AP module
3. Confirm cost center code assigned (INTAKE-*)
4. Set accrual schedule if usage-based
5. Update Monthly Budget table if new cost line

### After Each Month-End Accrual
1. Log estimated amounts per vendor
2. Log basis for estimate (prior actuals or pricing × volume)
3. Update Budget vs Actuals table with actuals when invoices arrive

## Escalation Protocol

### When to Escalate to Orchestrator
| Condition | Action | Priority |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| New vendor not in registry | Escalate for approval before AP entry | High |
| Monthly actuals >20% over budget | Escalate immediately | High |
| New service line cost appears | Confirm it belongs to INTAKE vs other service | Medium |
| GPU node decision | Escalate — capital vs opex classification needed | Medium |
| Vendor service outage | Alert engineering + escalate | High |

### Escalation Format
```json
{
  "escalation_type": "blocked",
  "agent": "benjamin-agent",
  "task_type": "vendor_onboarding | monthly_accrual | budget_variance",
  "reason": "New vendor [name] not in approved registry",
  "context": {
    "vendor": "vendor name",
    "category": "INTAKE-STT",
    "estimated_monthly": 0.00
  },
  "suggested_action": "Get finance approval, add to vendor registry, then create AP master record",
  "priority": "high",
  "requires_human": true
}
```

## Learned Patterns

### Usage-Based Vendor Billing Lag (Learned 2026-03-06)
**Context:** Twilio, Deepgram, ElevenLabs all invoice 15–30 days after the billing period ends
**Implementation:** Accrue at month-end using prior month actuals as estimate; true-up on invoice receipt
**Files:** GL accrual entries, AP bills
**Gotchas:** First month has no prior actuals — use vendor published pricing × estimated call volume
